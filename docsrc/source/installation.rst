Installation
************

PyVBMC is available via ``pip`` and ``conda-forge``.

1. Install with::

     python -m pip install pyvbmc

   or::

     conda install --channel=conda-forge pyvbmc

   PyVBMC requires Python version 3.9 or newer.

2. (Optional): Install Jupyter to view the examples. You can skip this step if you're working from a Conda environment which already has Jupyter, but be aware that if the wrong ``jupyter`` executable is found on your path then import errors may arise. ::

     conda install jupyter

   The example notebooks can be accessed by running ::

     python -m pyvbmc

If you wish to install directly from latest source code, please see the :ref:`installation instructions for developers`.
